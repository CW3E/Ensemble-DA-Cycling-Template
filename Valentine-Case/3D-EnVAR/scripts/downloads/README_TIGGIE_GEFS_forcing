Size of forcing data:

Total size 989G	GEFS_ensemble  apparant size is 1.2 T 
 118 directories each <DATE>_raw size variable ~ 8.4 G,  apparant size 9.7G 

Where date is 2017 Jan/Feb 2019 Jan/Feb


Instructions on how to download the forcing files:

	If you don't already, please register for an ECMWF account in order to download data from the TIGGE database. 

	https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/WEBAPI/Access+ECMWF+Public+Datasets

	Install ECMWF api key in your home area on pipeline.  I followed step 1.  

	Put key in ~/.ecmwfapirc
	

	Install mini-conda environment and ecmwf python client libraries:  
	following cw3e-wiki:  https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/cw3e-wiki/teams/it/how-tos/cw3e-it-python-on-cw3e-servers

		On machine where you are going to do the downloads:
  		%  mkdir Miniconda
  		%  scp -pr skyriver:/apps/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh .
  		%  mv Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh  Miniconda
  		%  cd Miniconda/
  		%  bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

	exit out of shell and then re-enter
  		%  conda create --name ecmwf_downloads
  		%  conda activate ecmwf_downloads
  		%  conda install python=3.8
  		%  pip install ecmwf-api-client

	Move script to directory
 		>> mkdir ECMWF_downloads
	 	>> mv MAIN_get-gefs_full_fields.py  ECMWF_downloads
		>> cd ECMWF_downloads

	edit MAIN_get-gfs_full_fields.py for dates 
	3 dates is usually enough at one execution to make sure things are going smoothly.
	NOTE: Download history is located in the Ensemble tracker:

		https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JVRfAs1YS_Uf48p06_wCrnUpGD_2FzEXFRMJJNaYjMA/edit#gid=0

	Note, you may need to accept terms for tigge dataset before first run:
 	http://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/licences/tigge

	Run code
 		>> python MAIN_get-gefs_full_fields.py
	NOTE when done need to deactivate conda env:
 		>> conda deactivate


NOTE: these are versions of the scripts:

	MAIN_get-gefs_full_fields.py.orig			Original version with all member calls including control
	MAIN_get-gefs_full_fields.py_no_control			Missing control member calls 
	MAIN_get-gefs_full_fields.py				Working version with control member commented out
